# Implementation of nutritional score for [FoodRepo](https://www.foodrepo.org) products

general goal: assess nutritional diversity on Swiss supermarket food using FoodRepo data

(work done in collaboration with [kirtanp](https://github.com/kirtanp) and [sharbatc](https://github.com/sharbatc))


## nice to-dos


-  compare NS with other profiling systems ( see this paper [Maschkowski, 2014](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1178)). Mind that:

  -  Keyhole (nordic), IWG and EU are _threshold-based_ 
  -  UK-ofcom, FSANZ (AUS and NZ) and Nutri-Score (FR) are _score-based_
